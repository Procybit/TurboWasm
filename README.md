## Installation

### Only extension

If you only need the extension, download [TurboWasm.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Procybit/TurboWasm/refs/heads/master/TurboWasm.js)

### Toolchain (Emscripten + batch scripts + examples)

For now, only Windows installations supported.

Clone repo:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Procybit/turbowasm.git
```
```
cd turbowasm
```

Run install.bat to automaticlly dowwnload, install and activate emsdk:

```
install
```

## Usage

- See example files [example.sb3](example.sb3) and [example.cpp](cpp/example.cpp).

- Place your .cpp files into `cpp/`. Start `compile.bat` to compile all .cpp files from `cpp/` as standalone modules. Compilled `.wasm` files will appear in `wasm/`.

- If you want to use malloc/free blocks from the extension, include `"lib/malloc.h"` in your wasm module.
